# 🎨 Generative AI Projects

This repository contains a collection of simple yet powerful projects built using **Generative AI**. These projects are designed to demonstrate the capabilities of modern AI models in generating content such as text, images, and captions using tools like **Transformers**, **Gradio**, and **Google Colab**.

---

## 🚀 Projects Included

- **🖼️ Image Captioning (BLIP)**  
  Upload any image and the model will generate a natural language caption. Built using the BLIP model from Hugging Face.

*(More projects will be added soon…)*

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Gradio** – for interactive web interfaces  
- **Hugging Face Transformers** – for accessing powerful generative models  
- **PyTorch** – for model inference  
- **Google Colab** – for quick prototyping and sharing

## ▶️ How to Run

### 🔹 Option 1: Run on Google Colab
- Open the `.ipynb` file on Colab
- Follow the instructions in the notebook
- No installation needed

### 🔹 Option 2: Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rameezuetian/Generative_Ai_Projects.git
cd Generative_Ai_Projects
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py  # Or any other script
```

---

## 📌 Goals

- Learn by building small generative AI apps
- Explore real-world applications of AI models
- Keep things beginner-friendly and interactive
