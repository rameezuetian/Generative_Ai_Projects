Perfect! If you're now running this in **Google Colab**, here's how you can adjust your setup:

### ✅ How to Run Gradio App in Google Colab

You don’t need `server_name` or `server_port`. Just use:

```python
iface.launch(share=True)
```

This will generate a **public URL** so you can access the app outside of Colab.

---

### ✅ Updated Code for Colab

```python
import gradio as gr
from transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration
from PIL import Image

processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")
model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")

def generate_caption(image):
    inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
    caption = processor.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return caption

def caption_image(image):
    try:
        caption = generate_caption(image)
        return caption
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An error occurred: {str(e)}"

iface = gr.Interface(
    fn=caption_image,
    inputs=gr.Image(type="pil"),
    outputs="text",
    title="🖼️ Image Captioning with BLIP",
    description="Upload an image and get a generated caption using BLIP model."
)

iface.launch(share=True)
```

### ✅ README.md (Updated for Colab)

# 🖼️ Image Captioning with BLIP (Google Colab Version)

This Gradio app uses Hugging Face's BLIP model to generate captions for uploaded images.

## 💡 What It Does

- Upload an image via the Gradio interface.
- The BLIP model processes the image and returns a natural-language caption.

## 🚀 Run in Google Colab

Open this notebook in Google Colab and run the code. A public link will be generated using `share=True`.

## 🔧 Requirements

Install the required libraries:

```bash
!pip install transformers gradio Pillow torch
```

## 🧠 Model

We use: `Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base`  
🔗 [Model Link](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base)

## 🖼️ Example Usage

Just upload an image like this:

```python
iface.launch(share=True)
```

A link will appear to open the interface.

## 📌 Notes

- Best run in Google Colab with GPU for faster performance.
- Public Gradio links expire after a few hours.
